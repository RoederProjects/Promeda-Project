    <reviewbody>Thank you all for your kind words about my lecture series. I am very glad that you have found them useful.  A few folks have requested the names of reference texts on the subject.  My notes are mainly from my own experience and many references.  I do not use a textbook in my course.  However, I do provide a list of texts for those who may want to consult one. They are listed in the 2010 syllabus that I have just uploaded.  It is the file EECE253_syllabus_F2010.pdf.  You may notice that the syllabus covers topics that are not in the currently available lectures.  That is because I am constantly tweaking the course and adding new subject areas to it.  Later this summer, I will be updating the lectures posted here so that they will be current with the course that I teach at Vanderbilt.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>ups, I just saw the note from Nov 1 and I find the files. anyway, perhaps it would be welcome that you add a remark on this (download loaction) in the description of the materials; as it is right now - titled with 'other files' - this does not seem intuitive at all. cheers, ljiljana</reviewbody>
    <reviewtitle>can't find it</reviewtitle>

To help save bandwidth, I have converted all 18 lecture notes from PDF format (210 MB) into DjVu format (74 MB) and uploaded them to:

http://ifile.it/xc0ora7

Also included is the MPG animation.

------------------ DjVu INFO.------------------------------------------------------------------------
DjVu plug-in (free) for Windows, Mac OS X, or UNIX: 
http://www.lizardtech.com/download/dl_options.php?page=doc

Open Source Reader for Windows or Mac OS X:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compare quality of PDF vs. DjVu, take a look at:
http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/a2c67d6d4c.jpg

The upload is archived in the TAR format, which can be opened with any common compression/decompression utility 
such as WinZip, WinRar, Stuffit, 7-Zip, and many others.

Cheers!
