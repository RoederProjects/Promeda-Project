Color Images 

• Are constructed from three 
intensity maps. 

• Each intensity map is projected 
through a color filter (e.g., red, 
green, or blue, or cyan, magenta, 
or yellow) to create a single 
color image. 

• The intensity maps are overlaid 
to create a color image. 

• Each pixel in a color image is a 
three element vector.

The 
Retina 

When measured in 104 
healthy people, the 
horizontal angle from the 
center of the fovea to the 
meridian through the 
center of the optic nerve 
head varied from 13.0° to 
17.9°; the vertical angle 
from the foveal center to 
the parallel through the 
optic nerve head was in 
the range -3.65 to -1-0.65°.^

Photoreceptor Densities 


The density of cone photoreceptors 
decreases from the high-resolution 
fovea to the periphery of the eye. A 
human eye’s field of view is about 155° 
of that, the fovea comprises the central 
2°. To see the world in detail requires 
active scanning by the eyes. A person 
does not see much more than he or she 
does see in most situations. The slides 
that follow mimic a multiresolution scan 
of a painting by a single eye. (The digital 
image processing in this case was done 
with a log-polar transform.)

Optical illusion are fasdnatingl They also teach us about our \Tsual perception, and its limita- 
tions. Emphasis here is on the beaut>" of perceptual phenomena, on interactive experiments, 
and explanation of the \Tsual mechanisms involved - to the degree that they are understood 

Befriending mobile devices: > 70 interactive demos now wthout Flash, but requiring up- 
to-date browsa: V'srsions. 

Don’t let it irk you if you don’t see all the phenomena described. For many illusions, there is a 
percentage of people with perfectly normal vision who just don’t see it, often for reasons cur- 
rently unknowm. 

If you are not a vision scientist, you might find my explanation attempts too highbrow. That is 
not on purpose, but vision research is not trivial, like anv^ science. So, if the explanation seems 
gibberish, simply enjoy the phenomenon ;-). More: Bach & Poloschek (2006) Optical Illu- 
sions Primer. 

Optical iflusion^ sounds pejorativ^e, as if exposing a malfunction of the visual system. Rather, I 
view these phenomena as highlighting particular good adaptations of our visual system to expe- 
rience. with standard viewing situations. These experiences are based on normal visual experi- 
ences, Eind thus under unusual contexts can lead to tnappropriate interpretations of a visual 
scene (= Bayesian interpretation of perception). 

Before we delv^e in. I’d like to express my thanks for V'our ©feedback; any advice is appreci- 
ated.
