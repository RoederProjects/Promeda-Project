EECE 4353 / 5353 


Fall 2016 


Goals: 

This introductory class in image processing should give the student a working knowledge of the most com- 
monly used methods and procedures for image analysis, enhancement and restoration. The emphasis of the 
class will be on practical results: given an image and a goal for its processing ( e.g . feature enhancement, color 
correction, sharpening, warping, etc.) the student should be able to select and implement an appropriate 
procedure to achieve that goal. Good practical results often depend on an understanding of the mathematics 
behind the procedures as well as the ability to write software to implement the mathematics. Thus, there 
will be significant mathematical and computational components to the class. In the past, most students 
have spent most of their time associated with this class either writing and debugging computer programs or 
writing the lab reports. 

The ability to explain results in writing is essential for a successful engineer. Therefore, the writing of 
lab reports will be done in the style of archival journal papers. The writing component of the class is very 
important. 

The course is available for both undergraduate and graduate credit. Those students who are taking 5353, 
the graduate course, will have additional problems to solve in each lab and homework assignment. These 
problems will be marked as such in the lab assignment instructions. 

Prerequisites: 

Recommended but not required: An introductory course in digital signal processing (such as EECE 3214 or 
EECE 4252), a basic understanding of the Fourier Transform, and experience in writing computer programs 
(in C, C-( — Python, Matlab , or Mathematica). Matlab will be used in class and in the lab instructions. 

Exams, Homework, and Grading: 

Your knowledge of the material will be assessed by your performance on 7 laboratory assignments and 7 
homework assignments. The score of each lab and each homework will be normalized to 100 points. The 
homeworks will count for 20% of your grade and the labs 80%. 

Unless an exception is stated explicitly within the instructions, you are to work alone on all these. You 
can obtain help on the mechanics of Matlab or any other programming language that you decide to use. 
But all writing, programming, logical implementations, and experiments must be exclusively 
your own work. Any collaboration or plagiarism {e.g. copying someone else’s report from this year or 
previous years) is an honor code violation and will be prosecuted. You may, of course, receive assistance 
from Prof. Peters or the Teaching Assistant. 

There are no in-class exams in this course, and there is no final exam. There will be one report due every 
Tuesday throughout the semester except for 22 November, which is during Thanksgiving break. If a lab is 
due on a specific Tuesday then a homework will be due the next Tuesday and vice versa. 

Laboratories: 

The labs in this image processing course are a bit different from those of most other courses. For each lab 
you will be given a set of image processing tasks to perform. These will require you to write computer 
programs to do the processing. You will be required to perform a set of experiments on various images and 
then to document the results in a written report. An example report is posted on the Blackboard web site 
for this course. The report will be in the form of a standard technical paper. The report can be prepared 
in any word processor you like. I will accept only electronic versions of your reports (no paper). You should 
submit the report electronically to the assignments section of Blackboard pages for this course. If for some 
reason you are unable to do so, please contact me to arrange an alternative. 

Homeworks 

There will be one homework assignment every two weeks alternating with the labs. Homework assignments 
differ from the labs in that they do not contain as much work as the labs. Also, Homeworks do not require 
a formal report. A homework report can have any format you like - as long as it is electronic. Homework 
reports will be due every two weeks on Tuesdays at midnight.

Rules for laboratory assignments 

1. Perform all the tasks listed in the instructions. 

2. Explain the tasks you performed in detail. 

3. In your report answer in writing all the questions asked in the instructions. 

4. Include in the report the original images you used and those resultant images that were specified in the 
instructions. In general include an image in your report unless told not to in the instructions. (The 
reports are electronic; it does not matter how large the files are.) 

5. In an appendix: Include all computer code that you wrote and used, clearly documented. 

6. All work must be yours and yours alone. Collaboration on the laboratory assignments is forbid- 
den, with the following exceptions: 

(a) You may obtain help on any aspect of the homework from either Prof. Peters or the TA for this 
course. 

(b) You may obtain technical help on Matlab from anyone you wish. However you may not get 
direct help on the implementation of the specific algorithm from another person except as noted 
in (a) above. 

(c) You may get help in obtaining the input images for the assignments from anyone you wish. 

(d) You may get help in the formatting, storing, or transmission of your reports, but not the content, 
from anyone you wish. 

7. Write the lab reports in a classical technical paper form (as shown in the example lab)using MS Word, 
Rl^X, or any other word processor with which you can embed images in text. Laboratory reports 
must be submitted in this format or there will be a significant points penalty (20%). I 
prefer that the reports be submitted in .pdf format, but that is not absolutely required. Submit your 
report to me as a file on Blackboard. If for some reason this does not work, please contact me for an 
an alternative. 

8. Name the laboratory report files using the form: 

EECE_X353_F16_Lab_n_LastName_FirstName . ext 

where you would replace X with 4 or 5 depending on the version in which you enrolled, replace n with 
the number of the lab. Replace LastName and FirstName with your actual last name and first name. 
Replace ext with pdf or doc. For example: 

EECE_4353_F16_Lab_l_Llurbybabbin_Lamoid . pdf 

9. Assignments are due at midnight on the day specified in the instructions or in class. The grade on a 
laboratory report will be reduced by 10 points (out of 100) for every day (24 hours) that it is late. 


Rules for homework assignments 

These are identical to the rules for the laboratory assignments with the following exception: Homework 
assignments do not have to be submitted in formal technical report format. The report can have any structure 
you like as long as the questions are numbered and listed in order and the answers are given below them. 
Images may be interspersed in the report or included at the end of the report. Any code you write must be 
included, although it does not have to be in an appendix at the end; it can be listed along with your answers 
to the questions in the body of the report. 

Homework report files should have the form 

EECE_X353_F16_HW_n_LastName_FirstName . ext 


similar to the lab report file name with Lab replaced with HW.

Late Lab and Homework Report Penalties: 

There will be one report due every Tuesday throughout the semester except for 22 November, which is during 
Thanksgiving break. If the report is due on or before 23:59 on day 0, then for day n=l : 10 the point penalty 
formula is (in Matlab ): 

PointPenalty = -(n-l)*10 - round (linspace( 1,10, 24) ) ; 

I.e. on day n it is — (n — 1) x 10 -ft 
00:00-01:59 -0 

02:00-03:59 -1 

04:00-06:59 -2 

07:00-08:59 -3 

09:00-11:59 -4 

12:00-14:59 -5 

15:00-16:59 -6 

17:00-18:59 -7 

20:00-21:59 Tr 
22:00-23:59 -9 


Expected Outcomes: 

EECE 4353 is an integral part of the EE & CS curricula, for those students who take it. Therefore, its 
has been designed to support the outcomes specified by the Accreditation Board for Engineering Teaching 
(ABET). In particular, the course has been design to support a students acquisition of the following ABET 
outcome requirements: 

(a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering, 

(b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data, 

(e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems, 

(g) an ability to communicate effectively, 

(j) a knowledge of contemporary issues, and 

(k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, tools necessary for engineering practice. 

In particular, the course presents probability and statistics in the context of image analysis and enhance- 
ment. It applies differential and integral calculus via Fourier analysis, convolution, filtering, sampling, noise 
reduction, etc., all of which a student implements in software programs for image processing of his/her own 
design. Many of the techniques taught and used in the course involve differential equations (in the form of 
difference equations), linear algebra, and discrete mathematics. 

Disabilities: 

The Vanderbilt University School of Engineering is committed to equal opportunity for students with disabil- 
ities. If you have a disability, you should ask the Opportunity Development Center to assist you in identifying 
yourself to the professor, so that the professor and the School of Engineering may provide you with appro- 
priate accommodations. Absent notification, the professor will assume that you have no disabilities that will 
affect your performance in this class or that you seek no accommodation for such. 

Emergency Evacuation Plans: 

In the event of a fire or other emergency, the occupants of the class room should leave the building through 
the nearest exit. The class should assemble at a safe distance from the building at a location indicated by 
the professor. Please note that VU policy forbids reentry, without authorization from VU Security, into a 
building in which an alarm has occurred. If you anticipate the need for assistance, please discuss that need 
with the professor.
