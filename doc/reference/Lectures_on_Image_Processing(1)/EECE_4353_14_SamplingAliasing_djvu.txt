Effect of Decimation on the DFT of an Image 

1. Decimation of an RxC image, I, by a factor of n results 
in an [R/n\ x [C/nJ image, J. 

2. The DFT of image J is the same size as J. 

3 . The uncertainty relation implies that the FT of J should 
be (R-l) x (C-l) < n lR/n\ x n LC/nJ < R x C. 


— 

Q: How can these 3 facts be true simultaneously? 

A: The FT of J folds over or aliases itself on the DFT of J 
because the DFT is defined on a torus.

First Alternative Explanation of Aliasing 

The aliasing phenomenon can be described in terms of the so-called “wagon 
wheel” effect. The name comes from the appearance in a 24 frame per 
second movie of a wagon wheel rotating slightly faster than 12 frames per 
second. It appears to be rotating slowly backward.

Nyquist-Shannon & Whittaker-Shannon Sampling 

If a function [signal or image] x(t) contains no frequencies higher than B hertz, it is completely 
determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced 1/(2B) seconds apart. In other 
words, a band-limited function can be perfectly reconstructed from a countable sequence of 
samples if the band limit, B, is no greater than half the sampling rate (samples per second). 1 

Given a sequence of real numbers, x[n], the continuous function: 


00 

*(0= Z x [ n \ 

n=— oo 


sine 


r t-nT^ 

r J 


has a Fourier transform, X(f ), whose non-zero values are confined to the region: l/| < 1/2 T. 
When parameter 7" has units of seconds, the band limit, 1/27", has units of cycles/sec (hertz). 
When the x[n] sequence represents time samples, at interval T, of a continuous function, the 
quantity f s = 1/7" is known as the sample rate, and/ s /2 is the corresponding Nyquist frequency. 
When the sampled function has a bandlimit, B, less than the Nyquist frequency, x(t) is a perfect 
reconstruction of the original function. 2

Second Alternative Explanation of Aliasing 

The aliasing phenomenon can also be described in terms of 
the convolution property of the Fourier Transform. In fact, 
this is the way it is usually explained.

Convolution Property of the Fourier Transform 


Let functions f(r,c) and g(r,c) have 
Fourier Transforms F{u,v) and G(w,v). 
Then, 

${f*g} = F-G. 

Moreover, 

${f-g} = F*G. 

* represents convolution 

• represents pointwise multiplication 


The Fourier Transform of a 
product equals the convolution 
of the Fourier Transforms. 
Similarly, the Fourier 
Transform of a convolution is 
the product of the Fourier 
Transforms

Convolution by an Impulse 


An impulse is a digital image, that has a single 
pixel with value 1; all others have value zero. An 
impulse at location (p, x) is represented by: 


S(r-p,c-%) 


jl, if r = p and c = % 
0, otherwise 


If an image is convolved with an impulse at location 
(p, x), the image is shifted in location down by p 
pixels and to the right by x pixels. 


\\*8{r- p,c- z)~\(r,c) = l(r-p,c- %).

Although the FT of the sampled image continues on indefinitely in theory, only 
one copy of the complete pattern is required for processing. The Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) algorithm computes the transform with the origin in the upper 
left. Usually the transform is displayed with the origin in the center.

Filtering Before Downsampling to Prevent Aliasing 



Thus, to down- 
sample I (r,c) 
by a factor of 2, 
use a spatial 
filter of width 4. 
Since this is 
midway be- 
tween 3 and 5, 
use a 5x5 
convolution 
mask. 

If the image 
is a bit blurry 
then a 3x3 will 
usually suff ice

Reconstruction of a Downsampled Image 

A band-limited image that was downsampled by a factor of 
two can be reconstructed - upsampled - using the Fourier 
Transform. 

Simply copy the FT of the downsampled image into the 
center of a complex-valued image of all zeros that has twice 
the dimensions of the downsampled image. Then take the 
inverse FT. 

This follows from the FT that results from multiplying the 
image with a “checkerboard” sampling grid. The following 
example with a Gaussian distribution demonstrates this.
