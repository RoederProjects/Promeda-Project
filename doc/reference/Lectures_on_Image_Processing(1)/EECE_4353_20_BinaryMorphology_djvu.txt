What is Mathematical Morphology? 
Jt h: 

• nonlinear, 

• built on Minkowski set theory, 

• part of the theory of finite lattices, 

• for image analysis based on shape, 

• extremely useful, yet not often used.

Notation and Image Definitions 

An image is a mapping, I, from a set, 5'p, of pixel coordinates to a set, G, of 
values such that for every coordinate vector, p = (r,c) in 5'p, there is a value I(p) 
drawn from G. Sp is also called the image plane. 

A binary image has only 2 values. That is, G = {Vfg , v^g}, where Vfg, is called 
iht foreground value and v^^g is called the background value. 

Often, in the literature, the foreground value is Vfg = 0 and the background is 
= - 00 . (That is to be consistent with the mathematical morphology of 
intensity images.) Other possibilities are {Vfg , v^g} = {0,oo}, {0,1}, {1,0}, 
{0,255}, and {255,0}. 

In this lecture {Vfg , v^g} = {255, 0}, or {Vfg , v^g} = {0, 255}, although the 
foreground is often displayed in different colors for contrast.

Notation and Image Definitions 


The foreground of binary image I is 


FG{l}={l(p),p = (r,c)e5p|l(p) 


= V 


fg 


Sp is the set of of all pixel 
locations in the image, i.e., 
the pixel grid, or the 
support of the image. 


i.e. the set of locations, p, where I(p) = Vfg. Similarly, the background is 


BG{I}={ I(p),p = (r,c)e5p 


I(P) = ^bg } • 


The two sets form a partition of the image: 

FG{i}uBG{i}=I and FG{i} UBG{i} = 0 . 

Moreover, 

BG{I} = {fG{I}}‘^ and FG{I} = {bG{I}}‘^. 

The background is the complement of the foreground and vice-versa.

Support of an Image 


The support of a binary image is often 
defined as the set of locations of the 
foreground pixels . /. e . , 

supp{l} =|p = (r,c) eSp|l(p)= Vfgj. 

In that case, the complement of the support 
is the set of baekground pixel loeations 
within the image plane. 

{supp{l}}'' = {p = (r,c) s5p |l(p)= 

But other times, the support is defined as 
the set of all pixel loeations in the image 
both foreground and baekground.

- whose support delineates pixel neighborhoods in the image plane.

Structuring Element locations in the image. 


Let I be an image and Z a SE. 

Z+p means that Z is moved 
so that its origin coincides 
with location p in Sp, 

Z+p is the translate of Z to 
location p in 5'p 

The set of locations in the 
image delineated by Z+p is 
called the Z-neighborhood of 
p in I denoted N{I,Z}(p).

Dilation of Binary Images

apply to binary images are:

(z+p)nfg{i}

image plane where the intersection of 
Z+p with the foreground of I is not empty. 


I©Z= U (z + p). 

Pefgjl}

each pixel location in the forground of the image.

Fast Computation of Dilation 

The fastest way to compute binary dilation is to use the union-of-translates-of- 
the-image definition. That is, use 

J = I©Z=Ul + q. 

qeZ 


Assume the dimensions of I are RxC, the dimensions of Z are NxM, and Z’s 
origin is offset from the upper left hand corner (ULHC) by rows and x 
columns. Allocate a scratch image, T, that is (/^+A-l)x(C+M-l) and initialized 
to zeros. Then, for each FG pixel loc (v, u) in Z (measured from the ULHC of Z) 
perform a logical OR between I+(v, u) and T. Put the results in T. When done, 
copy to J the RxC subarray of T starting at {p,x)'

Erosion from Dilation / Dilation from Erosion 

Dilation and erosion are duals of each other with respect to complementation: 

I^©Z = {I©Z}^ and I^©Z = {l©Z}^ 

That is, dilation with the reflected SE of the complement of a binary image is 
the complement of the erosion. Erosion with the reflected SE of the 
complement of the image is the complement of the dilation. It follows that, 

I©Z = {U©Z}^ and I©Z = {U©z)^ 

erosion can be performed with dilation and vice versa. That implies that only 
one or the other must be implemented directly.

Opening and Closing 

Opening is erosion by Z followed by dilation by Z. 

IoZ = (l©Z)©Z 

The opening is the best approximation of the image FG that can be made 
from copies of the SE, given that the opening is contained in the original. 

I o Z contains no FG features that are smaller than the SE. 

Closing is dilation by Z followed by erosion by Z. 

i*z = (i©z)©z 

The closing is the best approximation of the image BG that can be made 
from copies of the SE, given that the closing is contained in the image BG. 
I • Z contains no BG features that are smaller than the SE.

image, J, containing the tags. The choice of determines the 
connectivity of the result.

Skeletonization 

Let Skel(I,r) be the set of pixels in I such that if p c Skel(I,r) 
then D {r), is a maximal disk of radius r in I. That is, Skel(I,r) 
is the locus of centers of maximal disks of radius r in I. Then 

00 

5 = USkel(I,r) 

r-0 

That is, the skeleton of I is the union of all the sets of centers of 
maximal disks. 

Note that for any actual image I, the union will not be infinite, 
since I is bounded (not infinite in extent).

Computation of the Skeleton 


• SE = Zg = Sfe = Sq(3) 

• n = 0: SE = 1 pixel 

• n = 1 : SE = Sq(3) 

• n = 2: SE = Sq(5) 

• n = 3: SE = Sq(7) 


Note that the 
result is 
disconnected 
and has 
spurious points.
