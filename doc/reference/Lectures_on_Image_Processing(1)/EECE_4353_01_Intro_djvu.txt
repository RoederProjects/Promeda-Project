Color Images 

• Are constructed from three 
intensity maps. 

• Each intensity map is projected 
through a color filter ( e.g red, 
green, or blue, or cyan, magenta, 
or yellow) to create a 
monochrome image. 

• The intensity maps are overlaid 
to create a color image. 

• Each pixel in a color image is a 
three element vector.

Color Balance 
and Saturation 


Uniform changes in color 
components result in 
change of tint. 


E.g., if all G pixel values are 
multiplied by a > 1 then the 
image takes a green cast.

Convolution Property of the Fourier Transform 

Let functions /(r,c) and g(r,c) have 
Fourier Transforms F(u,v) and G(w,v). 

Then, 

g{f*g} = FG. 

Moreover, 

g{f-g} = F*G. 

* represents convolutio n 

• represents pointwise multiplication 
Then, a spatial convolution can be computed by 

f*g = $'{F-G}. 


The Fourier Transform of a 
product equals the 
convolution of the Fourier 
Transforms. Similarly, the 
Fourier Transform of a 
convolution is the product of 
Fourier Transforms

Image Compositing 

• Combine parts from separate images to form a new image. 

• It’s difficult to do well. 

• Requires relative positions, orientations, and scales to be 
correct. 

• Lighting of objects must be consistent within the separate 
images. 

• Brightness, contrast, color balance, and saturation must 
match. 

• Noise color, amplitude, and patterns must be seamless.
